                Derp is a 4-piece pop-punk/rock band from Madison, WI. They
                formed in 2008 when three of the band members talked about the
                idea after a show. They quickly called their first choice for a
                drummer. After he turned them down, they called Mark and they
                have been derping ever since. Derp consists of Mark Fairchild
                (drums), Nicholai Stratman (bass), David Mikulski (lead guitar,
                backup vocals) and Dan Edgette (lead vocals, rhythm guitar).
                Derp canâ€™t wait to play some live shows in the Madison area
                again soon!
